Subject: [PATCH] disable configuration validation during haproxy manifest
 apply since some files/options referenced in the configuration (such as for
 TPM) may still be in flight while the haproxy manifest applies. This
 validation option is a bit of an overkill anyways since it doesn't cause
 Packstack to fail the manifest application, and is a soft error log but with
 the added disadvantage of not applying any haproxy configuration (even the
 sane bits) on a validation failure
