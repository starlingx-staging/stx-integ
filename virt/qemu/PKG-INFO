Description:
qemu-kvm is an open source virtualizer that provides hardware emulation for
the KVM hypervisor. qemu-kvm acts as a virtual machine monitor together with
the KVM kernel modules, and emulates the hardware for a full system such as
a PC and its assocated peripherals.

As qemu-kvm requires no host kernel patches to run, it is safe and easy to use.
