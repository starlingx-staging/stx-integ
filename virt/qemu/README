Get the RedHat source rpm from:
$ wget wget http://cbs.centos.org/kojifiles/packages/qemu-kvm-ev/2.3.0/31.el7_2.7.1/src/qemu-kvm-ev-2.3.0-31.el7_2.7.1.src.rpm 

Uncompress the source rpm:
$ rpm2cpio qemu-kvm-ev-2.3.0-31.el7_2.7.1.src.rpm | cpio -idmv

All the patches from the redhat source rpm have been applied in git/qemu using
scripts/autopatch.sh.

Some of these patches can't be applied cleanly with 'git am'.  So this script
attempd to execute 'git am' on each of them, if it fails it tries to patch
the files manually with 'git apply --index'.

A git tag 'qemu-kvm-ev-2.3.0-31.el7_2.7.1' has been added to the last patch
applied.

The Titanium Cloud specific patches will be added after this tag.
